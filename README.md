This study analyzed data from the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data provided by MÃ–BIUS on Kaggle as well as the Lifesnaps dataset. 
The key discovery of the analysis is people want to make a behavioural change but are inconsisent in setting goals and manually inputting data. It is well understood in psychology that important aspects of behaviour change are self-monitoring, and setting small goals.

## Cleaning
I checked for correct ranges, data types, constraints, and consistency.

## Analysis
I avoided doing uneccessary comparisons like exercise vs calories. The business task clearly states an interest in usage trends.
I compiled all manual logging data and did an analysis on frequency and consistency of manual logging. I made sure to adjust for 
the fact that some users have more data than others when comparing and counting.

## Key Findings
People want to make a behavioural change but are inconsisent in setting goals and manually inputting data. It is well understood in psychology that important aspects of behaviour change are self-monitoring, and setting small goals.

## Recommendation
Based on this analysis, the bellabeat application should focus on incentivizing and reducing friction with goal setting. 
There could be automatic goal setting as an option and reminders at important intervals. 
The key would be to find the sweet spot between engaging challenges and gamifying goal setting without becoming annoying and intrusive. 
Women who use these devices are most interested in tracking steps, sleep, and/or heartrate. 
These metrics should be more forward facing than mindfulness sessions in the app.
